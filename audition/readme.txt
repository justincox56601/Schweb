1) implement a simple design section in HTML & costs
	I made the mockup.  You can load it from the index.html coument in this folder
	The image overlays are controlled via the aria-averlay attribute.  I wrote and added script.js to allow the developer to control the color and opacity.
	I also added aria-color to buttons so that you can easily change the button color semantically

2) Code Challenge
	The code for this can be found in challenge.js.
	the answer is implored.  I am also outputting it to the console on the mockup if you would like to see it.

3)if page load times are something that needs to be addressed I will start with a speed tool like this one from google
https://pagespeed.web.dev/?utm_source=psi&utm_medium=redirect
That will give me some pointers on where to start looking for that site/page.  Outside of that, in general:
	1) image sizes - loading 4K images that need to be turned into a thumbnail costs a ton of time
	2) Wordpress Plugins - having excessive plugins slows down loading time
	3) CDN - for smaller sites this isn't usually an issue, but with larger sites and a lot of traffic, using a CDN will speed up loading times.
	4) page caching - with sites that have a lot of traffic, using cached pages instead of having the server build the same page over and over again can speed up site load times

4) this took me longer than I would have liked.  I needed a good deal of refreshing on CSS.
	The mock up took me about 2 hours (mostly refreshing myself on CSS/SCSS)
	The mock up is not pixel perfect.  The exact colors and fonts are going to be off and I had to do some guessing on sizes / spacing.
	The second part, the challenge question took me about 20 minutes.  mostly just checking myself and making sure I was using maps correctly.
